Here is a project that I built using React and Django. This is a project I built for a small business. I create multiple API's and I also implement a full functioning contact
form that sends emails, and also sends a no reply email to the person that filled the form out. The person who I built this web app for has
access to a full admin dashboard, where she can post images to her gallary that will be automatically shown on the front end when she saves them.
